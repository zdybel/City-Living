<!-You will create a single web page for a fake company. Use HTML and CSS to fully style it using modern design trends and page layout. Use JavaScript to create a modal to appear after a given amount of time on the page. You will need to fully style the modal too so think about what this modal will be used for. Is it a pop-up ad? Is it a prompt to get the user to enter their email address to sign up for the company newsletter? Is it a prompt to get the user to share this page on Facebook? You decide but make it look as professional as possible.

The modal appears after 3 seconds of being on the web page.
JavaScript is fully functional and throws no errors
It is clear how the user would exit the modal (e.g. x or close button)
Clear usage of modal - the user understands what is being asked of them
Thoughtful styling has been integrated
Proper HTML formatting
Proper CSS formatting-!>
