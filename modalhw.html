Use JavaScript to create a modal to appear after a given amount of time on the page. You will need to fully style the modal too so think about what this modal will be used for. Is it a pop-up ad? Is it a prompt to get the user to enter their email address to sign up for the company newsletter? Is it a prompt to get the user to share this page on Facebook? You decide but make it look as professional as possible.
